      "I joined the PCOS Lifestyle program 3 month back, suffering from PCOS for almost 4 years. My biggest problems were irregular periods and facial hair. The first call that I had with the gynaecologist was very informative and she helped me clear all my doubts about PCOS. My nutritionist has also been very helpful and readily available throughout and I am so glad to see the changes already. I lost 2 kgs in a month, I have been eating better and exercising regularly and got my periods naturally after 2.5 months (79 days) of missing them. My hirsutism is majorly under control. My issue of sweating excessively due to thyroid has subsided too and I am now getting proper sleep of 8 hours every night. Thankful to the whole team.",
